# Introduction
LibCollections is a collections' manage application for library books, more specifically, SCUT library books.

This application bases on [MaterialHome](https://github.com/hymanme/MaterialHome) project, and uses [Material Dialogs](https://github.com/afollestad/material-dialogs) for user inputs and prompts.

Displayed books' information are generated from [Douban API](https://developers.douban.com/wiki/?title=api_v2), together with an [interface](https://github.com/KingsleyXie/NaiveProjects/blob/master/Snippets/book_location_api.php) as data parser from SCUT library webpages.
